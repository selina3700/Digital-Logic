<h1>COMP 1027 - Data Logic Coursework</h1> 
<h2>Part 1 Elementary Logic Gates</h2>
<p>Tessa is a talented baker who wishes to open her own café in 2025. In order to realise her dreams, she needs to secure a 
  location whereby her café can be open, purchased relevant furniture, enlist several helpers, and prepare a set of delightful 
  choices for the customers to choose from. For the short-term, she will be happy to successfully fulfil two to three of the four conditions, 
  namely a location and furniture or menu.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate a truth table to represent the conditions that Tessa needs to fulfil to ensure her café is successfully operational by February 2025.</li>
    <li>Implement a Tessa decision chip that prioritise what she needs to address to ensure a timely opening of her café.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Part 2 Combinatorial & Sequential Circuits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement an ALU chip (MyALU), of your own design, that computes 20 functions (the 18 functions covered in the lecture, in addition to the X XOR Y and X XNOR Y).</li>
    <li>The .hdl skeleton is provided, but you will need to create your .tst and .cmp files for this chip.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Part 3 The Hack Computer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This part concludes all the effort by completing the construction of the HACK Computer, i.e., putting it all together and have the HACK Computer working & executing instructions.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>MEMORY will be built according to the HACK architecture.</li>
      <li>CPU will combine the ALU and other circuits.</li>
      <li>All are connected as one chip (the “Computer”).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Part 3.1 Assembly Code</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Assembly Code that does Power</li>
    <li>Assembly Code that does Factorial</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Part 3.2 The HACK Computer</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement the Memory chip.</li>
    <li>Implement the CPU chip.</li>
    <li>Implement the Computer chip.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Part 3.3 Circuitry Diagram</h3>
  <p>Full circuit diagram of your CPU implementation.</p>
